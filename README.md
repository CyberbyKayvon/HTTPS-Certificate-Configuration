# HTTPS Certificate Setup with Local Certificate Authority (CA)

## üìå Overview
This project demonstrates how to create and deploy HTTPS certificates using a custom-built Certificate Authority (CA) and Apache2 web server on Ubuntu Linux. The project ensures a secure, signed connection is established and verified in both Linux and Windows browsers.

## üîß Tools & Environment
- Ubuntu 22.04 (Virtual Machine)
- Apache2 Web Server
- OpenSSL (for certificate creation)
- Firefox (Linux & Windows)
- Windows 10 (client test machine)

## üîê Steps Implemented
1. Created a self-signed root CA using OpenSSL.
2. Generated a server private key and certificate signing request (CSR).
3. Signed the CSR with the custom CA.
4. Installed the signed certificate on an Apache2 HTTPS virtual host.
5. Configured Firefox (Ubuntu & Windows) to trust the local CA.
6. Verified HTTPS connection showed as secure.
7. (Extra Credit) Adjusted SAN and network settings for Windows browser validation.

## üì∏ Screenshots
- Initial self-signed cert warning in Firefox
- Successful certificate chain validation (Linux and Windows)
- OpenSSL certificate output
- CA import steps

## ‚úçÔ∏è Notable Configuration Files
- `san.cnf`: Specifies Subject Alternative Name for certificate (includes LAN IP).
- `default-ssl.conf`: Apache site configuration to enable HTTPS.
- `myCA.pem`: Root certificate file used for signing.

## üß† Learning Outcomes
- Hands-on experience with TLS certificate generation and management.
- Understanding of trusted root certificates and browser validation.
- Gained insight into browser security warnings and proper CA chains.

## üèÜ Extra Credit
- Configured VM networking (Bridged mode) to test from another OS.
- Successfully trusted and validated custom CA in Windows Firefox.
